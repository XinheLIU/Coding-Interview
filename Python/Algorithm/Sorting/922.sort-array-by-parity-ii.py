#
# Given an array AÂ of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd,
# and half of the integers are even.
# 
# Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is
# even, i is even.
# 
# You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [4,2,5,7]
# Output: [4,5,2,7]
# Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been
# accepted.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 2 <= A.length <= 20000
# A.length % 2 == 0
# 0 <= A[i] <= 1000
#

class Solution:
    def sortArrayByParityII(self, A: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        j = 1 # odd pos
        for i in range(0, len(A), 2): # even pos
            if A[i] % 2: # odd num in even pos
                while A[j] % 2: # find even in odd pos
                    j += 2
                A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]
        return A
