# Testcase Example:  '[-10,-3,0,5,9]'
#
# Given the head of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending
# order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
# 
# For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree
# in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more
# than 1.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
# Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
# Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the
# shown height balanced BST.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = []
# Output: []
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [0]
# Output: [0]
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,3]
# Output: [3,1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The numner of nodes in head is in the range [0, 2 * 10^4].
# -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: ListNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not head:
            return None
        if not head.next:
            return TreeNode(head.val)
        # find middle
        prev = fast = slow = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            prev = slow
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
        root = TreeNode(slow.val)
        fast = slow.next
        prev.next = None
        root.left = self.sortedListToBST(head) if slow is not head else None
